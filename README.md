# Synthbox

This repo contains a Unity project focussing on synthesizing own sound in runtime.

For another project the sound of a Flamethrower is lacking and of interest. Unlike the portioned shot sounds of a machine gun, the sound of flames is an on-going process. Since I didn't find anything in the web, I decided to implement my own synth sounds in Unity using native C#.

This project is based on schlenkers [Unity 2D Template](https://gitlab.com/codevember.org/unity-2d-template)
